Hey there! I’m a passionate software developer from Bavaria, <span
id="year-count">less than 100</span> years young. In my spare time I’m an
active developer of free (as in freedom and also as in free beer) software. See the
bottom of this site for some links. I also do many other things, which I might
write about some day on this page. Come say »Hi« if you want to know more.

Until this happens, have a picture of a cat:
