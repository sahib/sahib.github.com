I'm a German software developer, currently residing in Augsburg (Bavaria)
Most of the time, I'm busy with writing free
software. I care for privacy, therefore you won't find me on social networks.
If you want to contact me, email is the way to go: <a href="mailto:sahib@online.de">``sahib@online.de``</a>.
Alternatively you can use my XMPP handle, which is named ``sahib@jabber.nullcat.de``.
If you want to talk privately to me, my GPG Key ID is [``AF3D5DAC``](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x60464F5AAF3D5DAC).
