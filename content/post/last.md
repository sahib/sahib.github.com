Hey there, I'm a software developer from Bavaria, being 25 years young. I just
finished my master's degree in computer science and now I'm trembling to decide
how to make a living out of my profession. In my spare time I'm usually writing
lots of free software. See the bottom of this page to see what those projects are.
See the next page to find out what languages and techniques I'm into.

## Contact

I care for privacy, therefore you won't find me on social networks. If you want
to contact me, email is the way to go: <a
href="mailto:sahib@online.de">``sahib@online.de``</a>. Alternatively you can
use my XMPP handle, which is named ``sahib@jabber.nullcat.de``. If you want to
talk dirty to me, my GPG Key ID is
[``AF3D5DAC``](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x60464F5AAF3D5DAC).

I also dislike some things, but that list would be too long and changes
frequently. Amongst other things that includes bloaty software and things that
have <span class="italic">»java«</span> in their name.
