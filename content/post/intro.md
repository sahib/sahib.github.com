Hey there, I'm a software developer from Bavaria, 25 years young. I just
finished my master's degree in computer science and now I'm diving into the
world of some kind of professional software developement. In my spare time I'm
an active developer of free (as in freedom and also as in free beer) software.
See the bottom of this site for my projects. See the next page to find out what
languages and techniques I'm into.
